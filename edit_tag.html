Your document originally didn't have XMP Metadata. It was 
initialized in the automatic check, and updated with any 
Document Information entries if applicable.
{% else %}
Changes were made to your metadata. There are two forms of storing it 
and in the case that neither the deprecated one (Document Information) nor 
the more recent one (XMP Metadata) were null, the document information 
entries for the keys <strong>Title, Author, Subject,</strong> and 
<strong>Keywords</strong> were replaced with that of the Metadata. 
The current entries of the Document Information may or may not be 
different than that of its original.
<br>
Here are the original entries of the Document Information. 
<ul>
	
	<li>TITLE : {{ orig_prop["title"] }}</li>
	<li>AUTHOR : {{ orig_prop["author"] }}</li>
	<li>SUBJECT : {{ orig_prop["subject"] }}</li>
	<li>KEYWORDS : {{ orig_prop["keywords"] }}</li>
</ul>
If you'd like to change the values in the <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/using/pdf-properties-metadata.html#view_document_properties">
document information</a> 
and in the <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/using/pdf-properties-metadata.html#edit_document_metadata">
metadata</a>. It is highly recommended that 
both methods of storing metadata hold the same values for the main 
keys mentioned above.
